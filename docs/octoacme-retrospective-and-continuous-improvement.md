# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Focus on actionable, specific improvements rather than broad themes
- Assign clear owners and realistic due dates for each action item
- Review and close out previous action items before discussing new ones

## Prioritizing Actionable Improvements

To ensure retrospectives lead to real change:

1. **Gather feedback broadly**: Collect what went well and what could improve from all team members
2. **Identify patterns**: Group similar feedback to identify recurring themes
3. **Vote or prioritize**: Have the team vote on which items will have the most impact
4. **Limit action items**: Select only 2-3 action items per retrospective to ensure follow-through
5. **Make them SMART**: Each action item should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound
6. **Assign ownership**: Every action item needs a clear owner who commits to driving it
7. **Set success criteria**: Define what "done" looks like for each improvement

### Action Item Quality Checklist
Before finalizing action items, ensure each one:
- [ ] Addresses a specific problem or opportunity
- [ ] Has a clear, single owner
- [ ] Includes measurable success criteria
- [ ] Has a realistic due date
- [ ] Can be completed within the next sprint or iteration
- [ ] Is within the team's control to implement

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Example Action Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Owner:
- Due date:
- Success criteria:
- Impact measurement: (How will we know this made a difference?)

## Measuring and Tracking Impact

To learn from improvements and build institutional knowledge:

### Impact Tracking Template
For each completed action item, record:
- **Action Item**: Brief description of what was implemented
- **Owner**: Who drove the improvement
- **Completion Date**: When it was finished
- **Measured Impact**: Quantitative or qualitative results observed
- **Lessons Learned**: What worked well, what didn't, what to try differently
- **Recommendation**: Should this be expanded, maintained, or retired?

### Example Impact Log

| Action Item | Owner | Completed | Impact Observed | Lesson Learned |
|-------------|-------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Reduce PR review time by adding PR size guidelines | Dev Lead | 2024-12-01 | Average PR review time reduced from 2 days to 1 day; 90% of PRs now <400 lines | Smaller PRs get faster feedback; team adopted practice quickly |
| Add risk review to weekly standup | PM | 2024-11-15 | Caught 3 risks early that could have delayed release | 5 minutes in standup saves hours of later coordination |
| Create onboarding buddy system | Team Lead | 2024-10-20 | New team members productive 3 days faster on average | Peer support reduces bottlenecks on leads |

### Sharing Learnings
- Review the impact log quarterly with the team
- Share successful improvements with other teams or in broader forums
- Archive retrospective notes and impact logs in the project repository
- Reference past improvements when planning new initiatives
- Celebrate wins and recognize team members who drove impactful changes

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes
