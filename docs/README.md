# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the central hub for OctoAcme's project management processes, workflows, and best practices. This README serves as your entry point to understanding how OctoAcme delivers projects effectively and consistently.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management processes emphasize clarity, structure, and iterative delivery, ensuring that teams can consistently and efficiently bring product ideas to fruition. At the core is a workflow divided into defined lifecycle stages: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective. Each phase is supported by key artifacts—such as project one-pagers, risk registers, backlogs, and release plans—which serve as single sources of truth for priorities, roles, and measurable outcomes. The process begins with thorough project initiation, validating business needs, stakeholder alignment, clear goals, and measurable success criteria before moving to planning, where actionable backlogs and milestones are established alongside risk and dependency management.

Distinct roles and personas are clearly outlined within the process. The Project Manager (PM) coordinates delivery, schedules, risks, and ensures transparent communication, while the Product Manager (PdM) drives product vision, outcomes, and backlog prioritization. Developers are responsible for building and testing features, maintaining high standards of code quality, and collaborating on technical design. Stakeholders—ranging from sponsors to cross-department contributors—are proactively engaged throughout the project's lifecycle, with dedicated communication paths to address feedback, escalations, and evolving requirements.

Communication is a cornerstone of OctoAcme's methodology. Regular cadences are enforced: daily standups to tackle immediate progress and blockers, weekly delivery syncs for consolidated updates, monthly stakeholder reports, and ad-hoc escalations when risks arise. These routines not only surface challenges early but also enhance psychological safety, ensuring that team members can raise concerns without hesitation. Status updates and documentation are kept current and accessible, often centralized in readme files or release docs, so that all collaborators—regardless of when they join—can achieve rapid context.

Quality assurance and continuous improvement are ingrained in daily execution. Automated tests, linting, security scans, and manual QA form a robust safety net before deployment. PRs are scoped small, require clear acceptance criteria, and must pass pre-merge checks and review. Every release is accompanied by a pre-release checklist, rollback plan, and post-release verification to minimize risk. Retrospectives close each project cycle, converting learnings into actionable improvements, ensuring that the process itself is a living system—always adapting to new challenges and team feedback.
